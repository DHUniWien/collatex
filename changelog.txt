Release 1.5
- Transposition limiter is moved from the Transposition Detector class to the DekkerAlgorithm class.
- The transposition detector is rewritten. It no longer works from left to right, but from largest
 moved distance to smallest moved distance. This improves the alignment result in case of longer witnesses. 
- Punctuation is now treated as separate tokens by default in the web-service.
- Improved handling of competing blocks of text in the IslandConflictResolver.

Release 1.4
- Workaround for a, b / b, a transpositions and Greek witnesses, where a segment of a single word
 can be longer than a segment containing lots of small words.
- Transposition limiter is moved from IslandConflictResolver to
 the transposition detector class.

Release 1.3
- First release with alignment based on the MatchTable approach.
This approach improves the alignment quality greatly in case of longer witnesses.
- Major API cleanup.
- New ColateX Tools package, containing a web-service based on JAX-RS.
- New Command-line interface.
