Release 1.6
- new aligorithm based on Greedy String Tiling
- Java 8 now required
- provide our own implementation of variant graphs
- remove optional and seldomly used integrations with Neo4j and Apache Cocoon
- turn collatex-core into a self-contained library, independent of other components
- package collatex-tools as a self-contained, shaded JAR

Release 1.5.1
- Extended the normalization in the javascript alignment table rendering to not only trim
 whitespace but also lowercase the tokens.
- Update of Google Guava to v15.0.

Release 1.5
- Feature: The merging and rendering of transpositions is now switchable in the web-service.
- Feature: Punctuation is now treated as separate tokens by default in the web-service and command-line tool.
- Transposition limiter is moved from the Transposition Detector class to the DekkerAlgorithm class.
- The transposition detector is rewritten. It no longer works from left to right, but from largest
 moved distance to smallest moved distance. This improves the alignment result in case of longer witnesses.
- Improved handling of competing blocks of text in the IslandConflictResolver.
- Fix: When splitting island in the IslandConflictResolver resulting islands were only
kept if there were of size two and up. Now they are kept if they are of size one and up.

Release 1.4
- Workaround for a, b / b, a transpositions and Greek witnesses, where a segment of a single word
 can be longer than a segment containing lots of small words.
- Transposition limiter is moved from IslandConflictResolver to
 the transposition detector class.
- Fix: PhraseMatches in the TranspositionDetector are now normalized in size. This fixes a problem where false
 positives where detected in cases where there are more than 2 witnesses
 and a specific case of variation between witnesses.

Release 1.3
- First release with alignment based on the MatchTable approach.
This approach improves the alignment quality greatly in case of longer witnesses.
- Major API cleanup.
- New ColateX Tools package, containing a web-service based on JAX-RS.
- New Command-line interface.
