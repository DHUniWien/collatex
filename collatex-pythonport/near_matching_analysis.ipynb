    "The witnesses start and end with perfect matches (*abcd* and *efgh*, respectively). Witness **A** has one token in the middle (*0123*) and witness **B** has two (*012x*, *01xx*) or three (*012x*, *01xx*, *0xxx*). The two or three candidates for alignment in witness **B** are all partial matches to the middle token in **A**, with different degrees of similarity. All permutations of the candidates in **B** are tested to determine whether **A** is aligned with the correct one.\n",

    "1. When there are just two options (left or right), the result is always correct.\n",
    "1. When there are three options:\n",
    "    1. The result is correct if the best match is on the far left, since the token never moves.\n",
    "    1. The result is correct if the best match is on the far right. The token moves to the far right on the first comparison and is never moved again because it's out of scope.\n",
    "    1. If the best match is in the middle, the result depends on the relative strength of the left and right matches.\n",
    "        1. If the right match is stronger than the left, the token will move there on the first comparison and then be out of scope, and not available to be moved back to the middle.\n",
    "        1. If the left match is stronger than the right, the token will remain in its original (far left) place on the first comparison, and the problem then reduces to two options, which always produces the correct result.\n",
    "1. Situations with more than three options are not tested, but should behave similarly to situations with three options. Specifically, the alignment will fail whenever a token is moved to the right *over* an even stronger match, since the rightward movement takes it out of scope for future movement.\n",
    "1. All testing was done with exac\n",
    "\n",
    "General conclusion: Because we always compare far left to far right, whenever there's a stronger match in the middle than on the far right but the far right is stronger than the far left, we will incorrectly move the token over the best match in the middle stronger match to the right, and it will subsequently be out of scope, and will therefore remain in the wrong final location."
