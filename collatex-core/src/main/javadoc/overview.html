<body>
A software component to collate versions of a text, for instance in order to produce a critical apparatus.
<p/>
CollateX resembles software used to compute differences between files (e.g. {@code diff}) or tools for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment" title="Wikipedia Article">sequence alignment</a>, commonly used
in Bioinformatics. While some of the techniques and algorithms are the same, this library aims for a flexible and configurable approach to
the problem of finding commonalities and differences in texts, sometimes trading computational soundness or complexity for
the user's ability to influence results. This is because the assessment of such findings in disciplines like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology" title="Wikipedia Article">Philology</a> or more specifically in the field
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism" title="Wikipedia Article">Textual Criticism</a>) is
often based on hermeneutic inquiry and as such can be supported by computational means &ndash; but such findings are not necessarily
computable.
<p/>
CollateX allows to compare more than two text versions (in the following called "{@link eu.interedition.collatex.Witness witnesses}"). This
achieved by merging the results of consecutive comparisons between a witness and all previously compared witnesses into a
data structure called a {@link eu.interedition.collatex.VariantGraph variant graph}.
