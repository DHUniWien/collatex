- step zero: calculate the permutations

- step one: take one permutation 
  result: Set<Match>

- step two: determine the match sequences
  result: List<MatchSequence>

- step three: determine the real matches

- step four: determine the transpositions
  result: List<Transposition>

- step 5: determine the gaps between the match sequences (from the real matches and the transpositions)

- step 6: analyse each gap to determine wheter it is an addition, ommission or replacement
