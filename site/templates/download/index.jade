                Should you target the <em>Java Virtual Machine</em> as your runtime environment and would like to <strong>embed CollateX</strong>

                runtime and development environment, we offer a <strong>tool suite</strong> comprised of a
                <em>command-line tool</em> and a <em>self-contained RESTful web service</em>. So whether your project is web-based or
                runs in your local environment, whether you write in Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript or some other language: This is
                probably the option to get started on.
